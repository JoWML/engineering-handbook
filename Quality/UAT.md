## User Acceptance Test (UAT)

UAT is the last step before we release our mobile apps to the respective Stores. It contains several use-cases that are critical for the User eXperience for aa Fishbrain user

If a UAT use-case is not passing, the bug is considered [**Critical**](https://github.com/fishbrain/engineering-handbook/tree/master/Quality#zero-bug-policy) and **has** to be fixed before release.

Both mobile apps share the same UAT use-cases that you can find [here for the year 2020](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LdxkOIzlR6jxbxedrmjcntAtjOWnzZljMcl6RqAkIic/edit#gid=719214631).

UAT use cases document is a live one. That means that those use-cases can change, get removed or new ones might be added according to the needs and importance to the Fishbrain user experience.
The critical areas of the app that need to be covered under UAT are
- Account creation / Login
- Pro benefits
- New catches/Posts and their privacy
- Push Notifications
- Feed
- Fishbrain Shop

The [Gear Team](missing-link) has created a [Fishbrain-Shop-UAT](missing-link) process for their ownership area, the Fishbrain Shop.
