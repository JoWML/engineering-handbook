# Tech Blog
We started our blog on Medium's platform for our first version. Medium is a well established writing platform that provides many tools for collaboration and it’s easy to use, requiring minimal setup. 

Since then we have moved on to hosting our own blog on GitHub. Hosting our own gives us more flexibility, we get to keep control, and we still keep a good reviewing process by utilizing git versioning.  

You can find our own blog here: https://github.com/fishbrain/engineering-blog

## Posting your first blog post

### Setup profile

Start by creating your profile by creating a new folder with your name in the author folder `public/content/authors/<your-name>/index.md`. In addition to a short description, you can add an avtar in the same folder. See current authors for inspiration. 
 

### First post

You can add a post by running:
```
yarn add-post
```

Exisiting posts can be found at `public/content/posts`. This [pull request](https://github.com/fishbrain/engineering-blog/pull/5/files) is a good example for your first blog post.

### Images

#### Original images

If you would like an original design for your blog post image, please open a design request. There is a link to design request from in #blog. If you prefer, you can create an image yourself, please make sure you're following relevant guidelines.

#### Stock photo

Choose one from any public domain resource. Unsplash is our preferred resource for public domain images.

Please add a reference to the cover image source, owner, and license at the end of the blog post, even if it doesn't require attribution.

## Cross-post to Medium

If you would like to cross-post you blog post on Medium you need to be added as an editor. Please send an email to your Medium username to developerblog@fishbrain.com or post in #it-support.


## Guidelines

* Stories should be related to software and product development and cater to that audience (design, product, engineering).
* Consider splitting your story in different parts if it is too long.
* Stories should not divulge sensitive information like internal KPIs, the company’s future plans, etc. If you are unsure if your story is safe to share, ask your manager.
* Stories should be written in English. Reach out in #blog if you need help.
