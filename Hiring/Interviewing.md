## Interviewing at Fishbrain

Interviewing is hard for both sides. In less than one hour, you both need to get to know each other and make a decision about whether or not you would want to work with this person. The following is an effort to provide a set of guidelines to make interviewing a bit less traumatizing for all involved parties.

### Before the interview

* Ensure you've read the description of the role you're going to be interviewing candidates for. Role descriptions can be found on the [careers pages](https://careers.fishbrain.com/).

* If you have any questions about the scope of the role, the team, or the responsibilities of the position after you've read through those resources be sure to reach out to the Hiring Manager with your questions.

* Open up the [interview kit](https://github.com/fishbrain/docs/tree/main/docs/interviews), and open find the candidates profile in Teamtailor, you’ll be able to view the candidate’s resume, the scorecard you’ll be evaluating the candidate against. 

* Be cognizant of where the candidate is at in the interview process. Are you the first interviewer? Are you the third? Be aware that the candidate has likely repeated themselves quite a bit and has already asked many of the general questions they had about the position in previous interviews.

* Make sure you're up to date on our latest headcount, messaging, and other facts about working at Fishbrain. Take a look at [What can I say about Fishbrain](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QG_-8qVpGp7N_omNiftIAY1r5AbZH4VFHfLV6gIcDT4/).

### Illegal Interview Questions

In Sweden there are technically no illegal questions. It's important to know we are not allowed to discriminate candidates, and base our hiring decisions on background not related to their skills.

You should not ask any questions about the person's race, gender, sexual preference, disabilities or health, political affiliations, religion, or family (children). In general, stay away from any questions and conversations around these topics, and focus instead on the job duties.

If a candidate does bring up personal information during an interview related to a protected class, it's okay to acknowledge their comment and get the interview back on track.

Personal information should be left out when submitting feedback in Teamtailor as it does not pertain to the functions and responsibilities of the role.

### During The Interview

* Show up prepared and on time. (See "Before The Interview" section above).

* Build rapport and put the candidate at ease. Introduce yourself, tell your Fishbrain story, ask how the candidate is doing, small talk is ok.

* Set expectations on how the interview will run.

* Cover the prepared topics/questions without being mechanical.

* Setup the interview plan in Teamtailor ahead of the interview to ensure all the areas you want to cover are in the scorecard.

* Try to cover the prepared topics, but keep the conversation smooth - it is ok to skip around.

* Redirect the conversation as needed - you are in charge of keeping the conversation focused and timely.

* Make sure to leave five to ten minutes at the end of the interview for the candidates to ask questions.

* Aim to know if, at the end of this interview, you want to work with this person.

* Manage expectations - Discuss next steps and timelines.

* Thank the candidate for their time.

### Reference Check

The recruiting team will ask candidates for references via email, People & Culture schedule a call and follow up on the provided references.

### After the Interviews

If, at the completion of the interview process, both the candidate and the hiring team wish to move forward with the candidate's application, an offer will need to be prepared. An offer is prepared by the Hiring manager and People & Culture.
