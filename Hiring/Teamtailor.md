## For Interviewers

### Application review
We strive to have a fast process on all steps in the process and this is especially important on the inbox and we shall have a target of maximum 7 days in inbox on all roles. When we review candidates we shall progress and reject candidates individually. When there is a need to have a second oppinion and support to ensure we act as unbiased as possible we shall call for a pair review session to get support.
