At Fishbrain, we work in purpose filled teams with their own objectives and goals. Most product teams are cross-functional teams, others can be comprised of engineers from the same domain. Below are the current teams at Fishbrain.


## Team Tuna



## Team Social



## Team Utility
The team responsible for helping our users find and catch bigger fish. We enable users to plan their fishing adventures by providing an engaging map experience, ML powered spot and species prediction as well as 7 days weather forecasting. Every fish that is caught can then be added to the logbook, giving our users an overview of their own fishing activities, complete insights they can learn from.
